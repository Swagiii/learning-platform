                            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is like giving instructions to your web browser. It's how you tell Chrome, Firefox, or Safari what to show on your screen.</p>

                            <p>Think of HTML as the skeleton of your webpage. It organizes your content - headings, paragraphs, images - but leaves the pretty parts (colors, fonts) to its friend CSS.</p>
