                <h2 id="what-is-html">What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page using markup. Elements are the building blocks of HTML, and they tell the browser how to display content.</p>

                <h2 id="history-of-html">History of HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It has undergone many revisions since its inception. The initial version was simply called "HTML." Over time, HTML has evolved to include more complex elements, attributes, and capabilities.</p>

                <h2 id="founder-of-html">Founder of HTML</h2>
                <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented HTML while working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). He is also known for creating the World Wide Web.</p>

                <h2 id="advantages-of-html">Advantages of HTML</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy to Learn and Use: HTML is simple to understand and write.</li>
                    <li>Supported by All Browsers: Every browser can interpret and display HTML.</li>
                    <li>Flexible: HTML can be combined with CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</li>
                    <li>Lightweight: HTML documents are typically small and load quickly.</li>
                    <li>Open Standard: HTML is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring it remains a free and open standard.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="disadvantages-of-html">Disadvantages of HTML</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Static Nature: HTML is primarily static and cannot create dynamic web pages by itself.</li>
                    <li>Limited Functionality: HTML alone does not offer features like interactivity, which require additional languages like JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>Browser Dependency: Different browsers may interpret HTML code differently, leading to inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li>Complexity for Large Projects: Managing large projects with just HTML can become cumbersome without proper structure and additional tools.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="year-of-introduction">Year of Introduction</h2>
                <p>HTML was introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version, HTML5, was officially released by the W3C in October 2014, and it continues to be updated and improved.</p>

                <h2 id="html-basics">HTML Basics</h2>
